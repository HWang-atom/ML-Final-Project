# ML-Final-Project
This is our project on handwritten recognition. The notebooks consist of: 

Proprocessing: 
1. DataCleaning_EDA : exploratory data analysis, subsetting training and test data
2. Image Preprocessing : KMeans clustering by shape, defining cropping boundaries, and preprocessing images to binarized arrays.

Modeling: 
1. OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
2. Light Gradient Boosting
3. Random Forest
4. CRNN
